# studNET-always-online
Install the client on a machine running Linux. A low-power client like the Raspberry Pi is recommended.
If you want to stay signed on in StudNET 24/7, the client must be online (=powered on) 24/7, too.

There is an auto-installer, `installer.sh`, included.
It will guide you through the installation.
After the installation, StudNET client will autostart upon each boot. The client runs quietly as a service in the background.

Note: This client is not affected by the official studNET Login Client Update to version 2.1.2.
