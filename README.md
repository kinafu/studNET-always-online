Install the client on a machine running Unix, Raspberry Pi or similar is recommended.
The machine must be online (=powered on), if you want to stay signed in. Use a low-power arm device to save energy.

There is an installer included, which checks for dependencies and creates a service.
After the installation, StudNET client will autostart upon each boot.
